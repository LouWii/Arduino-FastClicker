# FasterClicker

Small Arduino project to measure how fast you can click a button.

Push the button as quickly as possible when the LED lits up.

## Schematics

I've included schematics for this experiment as the Fritzing file as well. [Frizing](http://www.fritzing.org/) is an open source hardware initiative, and they made a really nice and [open source software](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app) to create electronic schematics.
